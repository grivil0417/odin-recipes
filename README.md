# odin-recipies

The Curent project is on creating a recipes page. I should be able to demonstrate basic html skills and git handling skills when Im finished with tihs project.

I will be creating a log file as well to log my daily progress in creating the recipes site.

During this project I have tested the skils I learned thus far for the foundations. Please do let me know what you all think. (i suck at design)
